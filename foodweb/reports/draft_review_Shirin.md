### Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?

The team is trying to understand how different methodology's of adding edges to a graph impacts connectedness and directness. It is unclear which experiment from the paper is being directly replicated. They demonstrate testing 3 models, but I am not sure what to be comparing their experiment results to. 

They clearly state and work to answer their question of finding how to increase effectiveness of bicycle paths with the least amount of monetary and infrastructural burden. The team explains the question and methodologies used to address it very well. 


### Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?

Yes, I understand the methodology and it makes sense for the question at hand. I see how infrastructural limits are being addressed (the easier it is to add an edge in each of their three models, the easier a bike path connection would be infrastructurally). This could possibly be due to my lack of understanding, but I'm curious to know more about how they are using these results to address the monetary component of their question. How can one directly link minimizing monetary impact to directness and connectedness of various models? (Seems like they are planning to work on this in the upcoming weeks, so I'm sure it will be adressed in future iterations)

### Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?

Yes,the results are clear, and the visualizations effectively demonstrate the difference between the two models. The figures are labeled with captions.

### Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?

Since not all results are completely acquired, the interpretation doesn't answer the question itself. However, it provides a clear and compelling explanation of how the final results will be interpreted, what assumptions will be made, and what factors will be assessed. 

### Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency.  Is it quantitative or qualitative?

I am unable to tell if the results are consistent with that of the original paper as it isn't very clear what the results of their model are being compared to. As far as the shape of the figure they provide from the original paper and the shape of the figure they displayed in their results, the shapes are similar, so it appears they are on the right track. It is a qualitative comparison at present, though I assume once they calculate directness and connectedness for their graphs, it will be more quantitative.

### Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Is it a sensible extension in the sense that it has the potential to answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?

They have not yet reached the extention stage yet. I believe they will look further into other types of graphs such as average commute time and cost of roads as an extension.

### Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?

They seem to be in the process of replicating the model and not yet at the extension aspect. Thus, they are slightly behind, but it seems most teams are at this stage. They seem well equipped to move forward.

### Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?

Overall, it is consistent with the style guide. There are some grammatical errors and some points where it does slip into passive voice. An additonal read through should correct those errors.

### Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style? 

The mechanics are mostly good. There is not a bibliography.
